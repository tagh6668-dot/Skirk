# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added a setup fallback from Drive `appDataFolder` to a normal Drive mailbox
  folder when Google Cloud CLI ADC is missing the `drive.appdata` grant.
- Updated setup login to request both full Drive and `drive.appdata` scopes for
  ADC so mailbox validation can recover cleanly.
- Fixed setup on VPS hosts with broken IPv6 connectivity to Google OAuth by
  automatically preferring IPv4 for `gcloud` login when possible.
- Clarified install commands to use the absolute installed binary path when
  shell `PATH` propagation is unreliable.
- Added donation placeholders to the README.
- Fixed Android sidecar startup validation so stale local listeners are not
  accepted as a healthy new engine, without using an Android parent-death signal
  that can terminate valid app-launched sidecars.
- Added Drive Mux v4 client/run namespacing so the same copied `skirk:` profile
  can run on multiple devices at the same time without response races.
- Updated Android and Windows clients to pass stable per-profile client IDs to
  the Skirk sidecar.
- Added Drive Mux v4 documentation as the single production transport.
- Added docs for exit-side proxy forwarding, mailbox janitor cleanup, live
  benchmarks, quota telemetry, and Drive Changes based discovery.
- Updated setup docs around one-line `skirk:` profiles, `serve-client`,
  `serve-exit`, custom OAuth device-flow setup, and Drive `appDataFolder`.
- Removed stale references to alternate runtime control lanes and visible Drive
  folder cleanup from user-facing docs.
